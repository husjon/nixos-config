# NixOS config

As I migrate from Arch Linux after 6 or so years this repository will contain the configuration for my systems.

I recently did a complete rewrite to separate out my server configurations since I wanted to switch to the unstable channel.  
This also included some changes in how everything was structured.

I am still very new to the Nix language and still learning hence there could be improvements made here and there.  
The entire declarative approach to linux is also something to get used to after many years of the "normal" imperative approach, although tools like terraform and ansible have been a nice steppingstone.
